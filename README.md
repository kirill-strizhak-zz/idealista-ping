# Idealista Ping

Userscript to automate Idealista search refreshing and new advertisment notification

## Details ##

Searching for a flat in Barcelona can be "fun". The housing market here is crazy now (in 2017). A decent flat with a reasonable rent can be gone in an hour after the advertisement is published. So being among the first to call is crucial to finding a good deal fast. And Idealista's email notifications for saved searches sometimes arrive too late. Which is why I wrote this simple userscript for myself.

## Usage ##

* Install userscript in Chrome with Tampermonkey extension or in Firefox with Greasemonkey
* Search for a flat in a neighbourhood you're interested in
* Apply filters to narrow your search
* Click on the "Enable" button at the top of the page to start the automatic check
* When you hear the beeping noise check the page for new advertisements
* Repeat for other neighbourhoods
